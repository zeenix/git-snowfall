# git-snow

It's a cold dark night on the Christmas eve and instead of spending some much needed time with family and friends, the helpless nerd that you are, you start to hack away on your hobby project. You look outside and see a lot of darkness. You wish it was snowing already and wonder how it will lift your spirits if it was. You sigh and get back to your uncommitted changes.

You then realize that you forgot what you were doing so you decide to look at the last commit. You type `git show` and hit Enter. Oh wait, what's this? you get an error message instead of contents of the last commit:

```
git: 'snow' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	show
```

"What?" you ask yourself and it takes you a second or two to realize your mistake: you typed `git snow` instead of `git show`.

Since you're a super nerd, you share this very nerdy joke with your friends. Turns out your friends are even nerdier than you and decide that this should be a command and should give you snowfall. They decide to take their laptop in bed and make it happen in a few hours time.

You're most welcome, my friend!

## Installation

Just `cargo install git-snow`. Then just `git snow` or `git-snow`. Or just wait till the next time you make the same typo.
